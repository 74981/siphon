= Introduction =

Currently, pjsip 2.0 includes the video support, also we will use it. And we won't backport video support in pjsip 1.x branch.

We use two external libraries :
  * [http://ffmpeg.org/ ffmpeg]
  * [http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html libx264]
The statement to compile these two libraries are given on this [https://github.com/rodisbored/ffmpeg_x264_iOS5_build site].
