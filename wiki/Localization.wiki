You can help me to complete translation or add new language.

For this, you must download *.strings* files at [http://code.google.com/p/siphon/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Siphon2/Resources location] in directories:
  * en.lproj
  * Settings.bundle/en.lproj

You must translate the right part of sentences. For example,
"Cancel" = "*Translation*";

When the work is finished you should create an [http://code.google.com/p/siphon/issues/list issue], and upload the files.
