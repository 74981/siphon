= Headers =

Apple doesn't publish all headers from Public Frameworks, and none from Private Frameworks.
But Siphon uses some headers. You can find its on [http://ericasadun.com/iPhoneDocs220/ Erica Sadun's] site, or you can generate alone with class-dump tool on iPhone.
{{{
   class-dump -H <Framework>
}}}

You need to do this for :
 * Preferences (PrivateFrameworks)
 * AdressBookUI (Frameworks)

Copy the two directories in _Headers_ folder.
