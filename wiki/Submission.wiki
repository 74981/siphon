#summary History of submission.

= Introduction =

I would like to write the process to submit one application for AppStore.
For the moment, Siphon was submitted five times.

== Fifth (06/01/2009) ==

I submitted Siphon 2.0.1 (06/01) with some new functions that you can see [Feedback here].

== Fourth (02/12) ==

I submitted Siphon (02/12) for iPhone and iPod Touch 2.
<p>The December 7th, Apple informed me, he need more time to finalize the review.
I never received an answer.</p>

== Third (27-29/11) ==
<p>I submitted Siphon (27/11) but I found a bug so I re-submitted Siphon (29/11) before Apple review.</p>
<p>Apple refused "because the VoIP service is active over the cellular network". Like you can see on the screenshot that I received, they tested on iPod touch. So the test was not complete.</p>
<p>In fact when SIP is unreachable or Wi-Fi is unavailable, Siphon asks to users to make a cellular call. Maybe in USA, GSM is unknown.</p>

== Second (~13/11) ==
I submitted Siphon (~13/11) with new functionalities.<br/>
Apple refused because GUI was too close to MobilePhone application of iPhone.<br/>
In fact, with my compilation problems the GUI didn't work correctly. So I understand now why Apple refused Siphon.<br/>
I corrected these problems and now Siphon displays the status of connection.


== First (25/10) ==
I submitted Siphon (25/10) before I leave in holiday with my family in Spain (Galicia).<br/>
Apple refused because I didn't give a SIP account (27/10).<br/>
So When I came back, I create a new SIP account and I gave them it.<br/>
