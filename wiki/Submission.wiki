#summary History of submission.

= Introduction =

I would like to write the process to submit one application for AppStore.
For the moment, Siphon was submitted three times.

== Third (27-29/11) ==
I submitted Siphon (27/11) but I found a bug so I re-submitted Siphon (29/11) before Apple review.


== Second (~13/11) ==
I submitted Siphon (~13/11) with new functionalities.<br/>
Apple refused because GUI was too close to MobilePhone application of iPhone.<br/>
In fact, with my compilation problems the GUI didn't work correctly. So I understand now why Apple refused Siphon.<br/>
I corrected these problems and now Siphon displays the status of connection.


== First (25/10) ==
I submitted Siphon (25/10) before I leave in holiday with my family in Spain (Galicia).<br/>
Apple refused because I didn't give a SIP account (27/10).<br/>
So When I came back, I create a new SIP account and I gave them it.<br/>
