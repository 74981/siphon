= Manual Installation =

The preferred method of installing Siphon is through the [http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/ AppTapp Installer]. However, if you are unable to or prefer not to use the Installer, you can follow the steps below to install Siphon manually.

*NOTE:* Siphon requires firmware version 1.1.X.


  * Copy !dist/Siphon.app into /Applications or /Widgets on your device. You may see some error messages during this process, are there are several symbolic links in here that the Installer source would normally deal with. You can safely ignore these errors as we will copy the files manually.
  * Copy !dist/SiphonSettings.bundle into /System/Library/PreferenceBundles/SiphonSettings.bundle on your device.
  * Copy !dist/SpringBoard.app into /System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app on your device.

Next, run the following commands to complete the installation:
{{{
/Applications/Siphon.app/Siphon --installPrefBundle
}}}
{{{
killall SpringBoard
}}}
